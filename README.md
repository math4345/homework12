# üéØ Goal: Topological spaces

## Objective

After having seen a bit about metric spaces, this week we survey the
theory of topological spaces.  Some of you may have seen some of this
before (e.g., in the setting of real analysis), but in the setting of
Lean, the biggest challenge is handling the more complicated set
theory, e.g., indexed families of sets.

## üöÄ Getting Started: Your Step-by-Step Guide

Setting up a new environment often takes more time than expected, so let's break it down into manageable steps.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Accept the GitHub Classroom Assignment

Accept this homework assignment in GitHub Classroom. This will enable
you to clone your own repository.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository

Once the assignment is accepted, clone your new repository to your
local machine.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Project Setup

Follow the [official guide for setting up an existing Lean
project](https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/project.html)
to set up your development environment.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Fetch Prebuilt Dependencies

Run the following command to fetch the pre-built `mathlib` files. This is significantly faster than building `mathlib` on your local machine:

```bash
lake exe cache get
```
